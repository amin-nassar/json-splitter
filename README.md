# 🧩 JSON Splitter

**JSON Splitter** is a tiny tool built to help **designers** work with large JSON files exported from Figma (typically design tokens or variable collections).

Instead of editing raw JSON by hand or duplicating files for each theme, this app lets you:

- 🗂 **Upload** a JSON file (drag & drop or file picker)
- ✅ **Select** the keys (collections) you want to keep
- 📄 **Copy** or **Download** the filtered JSON
- ✏️ **Rename** the downloaded file (optional)

It’s fast, minimal, and built with non-devs in mind.

## ✨ Why?

During a **Design Systems & Tokens Bootcamp**, my fellow designers were struggling to manage JSON files generated from Figma plugins. Each file contained multiple theme collections, and they had to manually split/edit them — a fragile and frustrating process (especially for those who don't know about coding or JSON syntax).

**JSON Splitter** was created to simplify that pain.
